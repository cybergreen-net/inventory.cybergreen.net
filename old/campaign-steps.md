title: Mitigation Campaign Steps
---

## 1. National CERT or equivalent organization reaches out to constituent remediators to engage them to participate in a focused mitigation campaign.

Depending on the target risk conditions to mitigate, remediators could be ISPs, network owners, product vendors, etc.

<h4> Example: </h4>
1. Target risk conditions: Open SSDP
2. Mitigation methods:
-  Reconfigure the misconigured devices.  
-  Block udp/1900 altogether at the edge of their network.  Block legacy protocols like chargen and echo that donâ€™t have any real use other than DDOS anymore.
3. Campaign time period: 6 months to 1 year.

## 6. Remediators start mitigation over risk conditions.
* Mitigation training material will be provided by CyberGreen
* Ensuring that ISPs are ready to take action will be the national CERT or coordinator's role
